This is the repository to hold hands-on practices on learning the basic toolset (Lua/Luau), then searving the game programming in Roblox Studio.

Some starting resources:

- Roblox Studio
- Roblox Creator
- Lua at lua.org
- Luau - the customized Lua by Roblox
- LOVE Platform

Look at the [mindmap of learning](/RobloxGameProgramming.html)

There will be series videos to be captured for recording the learning journey, see at [my YouTube Channel List](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6DEHvciXKeXNjL7xG9WXx6NgGeJC30Zz).

Enjoy!
